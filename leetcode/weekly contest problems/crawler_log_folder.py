# The Leetcode file system keeps a log each time some user performs a change folder operation.

# The operations are described below:

# "../" : Move to the parent folder of the current folder. (If you are already in the main folder, remain in the same folder).
# "./" : Remain in the same folder.
# "x/" : Move to the child folder named x (This folder is guaranteed to always exist).
# You are given a list of strings logs where logs[i] is the operation performed by the user at the ith step.

# The file system starts in the main folder, then the operations in logs are performed.

# Return the minimum number of operations needed to go back to the main folder after the change folder operations.
